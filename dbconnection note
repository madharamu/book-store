// dbconnection.js file
------------------------
var mongoose = require('mongoose');
var db = 'mongodb://localhost/osi';
mongoose.connect(db);

module.exports;

// app.js file
------------------------
// db connection from external dbconnection.js file
var db = require('./dbconnection');



We can use an external file for db coneection (dbconnection.js in our case), 
then remove the connection code in app.js file and replace it with below code which is of one line 

var db = require('./dbconnection');

so now we removed the code which is of three line in app.js and replaces it with just a single line

app.js (internal db connection)
-------------------------------
var mongoose = require('mongoose');
var db = 'mongoose://localhost/osi';
mongoose.connect(db);

app.js(after using external db connection file)
------------------------------------------------
var db = require('./dbconnection');


-> Here we are just placing all the three lines of code in other file and in app.js we just calling and using that module of code.
